# -MH.One
MH.One Cipher is a simple and innovative web tool that encrypts text (short or long) using a new cryptographic language called MH.One. This cryptographic language is designed by combining character shifting and a unique keyword-based algorithm that is not copied from any existing standard (such as AES or Base64).
