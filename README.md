# -MH.One
MH.One Cipher is a simple and innovative web tool that encrypts text (short or long) using a new cryptographic language called MH.One. This cryptographic language is designed by combining character shifting and a unique keyword-based algorithm that is not copied from any existing standard (such as AES or Base64). Users can enter their text, get a keyword, and save the encrypted text. To decrypt, only the same keyword can be used to recover the original text; the wrong key will produce an unintelligible result. Your GitHub name (0xbahari) is displayed as a signature in the user interface. Why is it innovative and sensible? New cryptographic language (MH.One): This language uses a combination of character shifting, inversion, and keyword-based transformation that is unique and not copied from any standard algorithm.
Uses: Suitable for encrypting personal messages, sensitive notes or even crypto games (like sending secret messages to friends).
Local security: All operations are performed in the browser and do not require a server, so the data remains on the user's device.
MH.One Cryptography Language MH.One Language Features: Structure: Character Shift: Each character of the text is shifted based on the sum of the ASCII codes of the keyword.
Dynamic Reversal: A portion of the text (based on the length of the key) is reversed to make the algorithm more complex.
Key-based transformation: The keyword is converted to a number (the sum of the ASCII codes) that is applied to all characters.
Unique Keyword: For each text, a keyword is generated that can only be used to decrypt the text.
Innovation: This language uses a combination of shift, reversal, and key dependency, which distinguishes it from common algorithms (such as XOR or Base64).
Limitations: This is a simple algorithm for educational and creative purposes and is not recommended for professional security (such as banking).
Security feature: Without the correct keyword, decryption results in gibberish.
